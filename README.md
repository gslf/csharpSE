### Algorithm and Data Structures implemented in C#
---

I have created a well-commented and documented collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in C#. The primary goal of this code is to ensure ease of understanding. I have taken every possible measure to make the functionality of each solution clear, typically with the goal of achieving clarity upon the first reading (and, in some cases, perhaps even after a second one). It is important to note that this proposal may not always represent the most comprehensive or efficient solution; however, it is consistently the most understandable and generally usable, even in production environments.
